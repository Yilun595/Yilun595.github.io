This submitted project features a design concept of "Sensory Hills and Valleys: Urbanized Natural Experience Scheme". On the basis of site conditions and historical context, three distinctive coherent spaces, "Hill of Cloud ", "Hill of Wind " and " Valley of Mist", are created. This plan provides 7/24 multi-functional spaces for Kwun Tong community residents.

Different from the original concept of triggering the five senses of human by using plants, this concept plan extracts three elements in nature which are closely related to human perception, namely "cloud", "wind" and "fog", and exhibits nature experience in a highly urbanized costal context through the means of abstraction and space creation. The human sensory is integrated with different landscape elements, so as to the renovation of the Kwun Tong Sensory Garden.

This concept plan enhances the spatial experience of visitors by creating a "hill and valley" system by creating micro-topographic changes in multiple forms. The " Hill of Cloud" section features a combination of characteristic conical terrain and floating "cloud" elements suspending in the air. The floating device is planned to use lightweight recycled plastic to reflect the land use history of light industrial in the past. The conical terrain is planted with shade-tolerant herbal plants, which allow people to touch and feel plants. The " Valley of Mist" section combines water features and suspension bridges with mist spray devices to create a touch and smell experience immersed in the mist. The water feature exhibit multiple usages in different scenarios. Multiple spaces for resting are created on the terrace. With a clear function of the skate park, the section "Hill of Wind" transforms the senses of the wind into visible elements through the air-moving device suspending in the air, forming a dynamic space for the young generation.

This plan also features a close connection between the site and the space under the Kwun Tong Bypass, which provides multi-functional spaces for community activities of various groups of people. Functions such as Kwun Tong Community Cinema, Kwun Tong Market, Kwun Tong Performersâ€™ Stage, etc., are planned under different scenarios and time of the day. This plan aims at providing diversified nature senses experience as well as multi-functional spaces and bring together local communities at present and future.
