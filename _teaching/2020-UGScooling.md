Urban heat island has long been documented, as well as the significant cooling effects of urban green spaces. By taking urban parks in Beijing as study cases, this research project evaluated the regulating effects of urban green spaces on micro to local scale cooling. The cooling intensity of urban parks, as well as its influencing factors were examined. Results are expected to guide future evidence-based planning and design of urban parks in Beijing, as well as future renewal of these urban parks located at the core area of Beijing, China.
