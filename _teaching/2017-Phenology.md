Phenological changes of vegetation bring diversity to the urban landscape, especially in temperate regions. By taking Beijing as a study case, this research project evaluated the phenological changes of landscape plants at both individual and plant community level. Results obtained were expected to aid planting design.

Phenology observation of commonly used woody species
----
Phenology observations of 80 widely-used woody plants were conducted during growing season in 2016 (March-November). BBCH scale was applied to record the phenological stages. Visualization of phenological map shown below provides a direct reference to planting design.
