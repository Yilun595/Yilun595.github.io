[CV](http://yilun595.github.io/files/YilunLi-CV.pdf)

I am a PhD student at the `Division of Landscape Architecture`, Faculty of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Dr. Chao Ren. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in `Landscape Gardening` and master's degree in `Ornamental Plants and Horticulture` from Beijing Forestry University in `2017` and `2020`. Prior to my PhD study, I worked as an assistant landscape designer at `AECOM` Beijing office.

My current research evaluates the association between `urban greenery configuration` and `thermal comfort enhancement` under a densely built high-rise communitiesâ€™ context. Further, this knowledge will contribute to future landscape design practice.
